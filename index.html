                Hello! I'm Daniella Boulos, a dedicated college student majoring in Cybersecurity 
                who is graduating in May 2025 and pursuing a CompTIA Security+ certification. 
                My passion for technology and security has driven me to explore various aspects of this field 
                through hands-on projects and coursework.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have experience working with Virtual Machines (VMs) using VMware such as Kali Linux and Metasploit.
                This experience has allowed me to gain knowledge in various Cybersecurity tools including Tenable
                Nessus, Nmap, and pfSense.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I have acquired coding skills in several programming languages. I am adept in Python,
                SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through my projects and hands-on experience, I have learned the
                importance of staying updated with the latest Cybersecurity trends and continuously improving my
                technical knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not working on coding or overcoming Cybersecurity challenges, I enjoy hanging out 
                with friends, watching movies, listening or playing music, and crocheting. Having these other
                hobbies allows me to maintain a balanced and well-rounded lifestyle.
            </p>
